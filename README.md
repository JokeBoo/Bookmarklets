# Creating a Bookmarklet:

Step 1. Copy Code, Make sure to look and see if there is a 'javascript:' at the beginning. 

Step 2. Double or left click on your bookmarks bar. Then click 'Add Page..'

Step 3. Delete the URL section by pressing ctrl+a then backspace or delete.

Step 4. If there was a 'javascript:' at the begginning of the code, then paste the code into the URL. If not, type 'javascript:' into the bar and paste the code WITHOUT a space inbetween.

Step 5. Rename the bookmark to whatever, then click save.

Activation: when on the page the bookmark is for, click the bookmark. That's all!
